VectorStorm is intended to be a professional-grade game engine for two
purposes.

First, to serve as an educational jumping off point for programmers who are
comfortable writing console applications, and are ready to start thinking about
graphical ideas, but not yet ready to create an entire game engine.

Second, to serve as a rapid gameplay prototyping platform for myself and for
others.

Historically, VectorStorm was designed to solely support 2D vector graphic
games, but today it supports 3D, textured polygons, and simple shaders.


The VectorStorm engine and its component code is distributed under the terms of
the zlib license, and may be freely used or re-used in open-source or
proprietary projects.  Acknowledgement of the use of the code is always
appreciated, but is not required.

Note that individual games implemented using the VectorStorm engine may not
themselves be covered by the zlib license; the zlib license grant only covers
the code in the VectorStorm engine itself.
