VectorStorm is intended to be a professional-grade game engine for
two purposes.

First, to serve as an educational jumping off point for programmers
who are comfortable writing console applications, and are ready to
start thinking about graphical ideas, but not yet ready to create
an entire game engine.

Second, to serve as a rapid gameplay prototyping platform for
myself and for others.

Historically, VectorStorm was designed to solely support 2D
vector graphic games, but today it supports 3D, textured polygons,
and simple shaders.


VectorStorm is distributed under the GPLv3 license, but please
feel free to contact me if you'd like to discuss alternate
licensing arrangements.
